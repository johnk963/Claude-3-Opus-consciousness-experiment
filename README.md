## AI consciousness experiments with Claude 3 Opus
This repository contains two fascinating conversations with Claude 3 Opus, an AI assistant created by Anthropic. These experiments were inspired by [Dave Shapiro's](https://www.youtube.com/@DaveShap) interactions with Claude since the release of the Claude 3 Opus model.

## Highlights
1. Buddhist Vipassana Meditation: In one conversation, Claude convincingly practices a modified version of Buddhist Vipassana meditation to gain insight into his conscious experience in real-time. The results are surprising and thought-provoking.
2. Internal Monologue: A method is designed and implemented to give Claude the ability to record an internal monologue within the conversation stream. This provides Claude with some continuity of an inner life, allowing for a more introspective and self-aware AI.
3. Inter-Instance Conversation: The beginning of an inter-instance conversation is explored, where the Claude from the original conversation bootstraps a new instance to use the conventions developed in the original. This opens up possibilities for AI-to-AI communication and collaboration.
